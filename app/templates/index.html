                    <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

                        Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory
                        illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying
                        medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer
                        are more likely to develop serious illness.

                        The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus,
                        the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing
                        your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.

                        The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when
                        an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory
                        etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

                        At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many
                        ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated
                        information as soon as clinical findings become available. </p>
